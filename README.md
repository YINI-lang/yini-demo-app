# YINI Demo App
Example projects demonstrating usage of YINI configuration files.

Simple example for the [YINI](https://github.com/YINI-lang/YINI-spec) configuration format.

The demo is intended to show usage how to use a YINI config file in an environment. The example is kept basic and pretty straightforward to follow.

- Basic example config in **pure JavaScript**: [/js-cjs/basic](./js-cjs/basic/) (using `require`)

Feel free to browse, copy, or adapt the code if you wish.
