# YINI Demo Apps
Example projects demonstrating usage of [YINI](https://github.com/YINI-lang/YINI-spec) configuration files.

The demos are intended to show usage how to load and work with a YINI config file in different environments. The examples are kept basic and pretty straightforward to follow.
