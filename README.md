# YINI Demo Apps
Example projects showing how to use [YINI](https://github.com/YINI-lang/YINI-spec) configuration files.

YINI is a minimal, human-readable config format â€“ like INI, but with type-safe values, nested sections, comments, and optional strict mode.

The demos are intended to illustrate how to load and work with a YINI config file in different environments. The examples are kept basic and pretty straightforward to follow.
